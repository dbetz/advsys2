# advsys2
A major update to AdvSys switching to a C-like syntax.

Still incomplete.

- Finish try/catch/finally.
- Finish throw.
- Cleanup local vs global memory allocation.
- Free local memory after each function is compiled.
- Need a way to parse user input.
- Need to support word lists for NOUNS, VERBS, etc.
- Need to update the Spin version of the bytecode interpreter.
