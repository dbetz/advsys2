# advsys2
A major update to AdvSys switching to a C-like syntax.

Still incomplete.

- Strings and Objects need to be constant values.
- Need to support local variable initialization.
- Need a way to parse user input.
- Need to support word lists for NOUNS, VERBS, etc.
- Need to update the Spin version of the bytecode interpreter.
